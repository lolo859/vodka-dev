# vodka documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Vodka transcoder and vodka-lib, the C++ library designed to provide gateway for Vodka code transcodage to Kernel Code to the Vodka transcoder and other third-party programs. We recommand you read the [Vodka codebase documentation](https://github.com/lolo859/vodka/docs/vodka-codebase.md) first before aptempting to use 

## Dependencies

The Vodka transcoder and vodka-lib have the following dependencies in order to be build :
- termcolor by ikalnytskyi
- nlohmann/json
- base64
- boost

The first two are already included inside the dependencies folder. Boost version need to be at least 1.84 (1.88 is the recommended version) and, because of his unavaibality on packages managers, need to be compiled by hand. The compilation script need Boost to be located in the system folder.

## Installation

For the moment, there aren't any official package file so you will have ether to use the binaries included in each release or compile yourself the program. We provide a .sh file for easier compiling.

### vodka

To install vodka, you can clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lolo859/vodka.git
```

Compile the program with:

```sh
comp.sh
```

This generate a static executable in the working directory. Please ensure you are in the root folder of the repository.

Warning: the compiling script use g++ for compiling each file. Compiling with other compiler hasn't been tested and aren't officialy supported.

### vodka-lib

To install vodka-lib, you can clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lolo859/vodka.git
```

Include the header in your C++ source file:

```cpp
#include "vodka-lib.h"
```

Compile the library with ```comp.sh library```. Don't forget to include the .a file by passing ```-L. -lvodka``` to your compiler. Please ensure you are in the root folder of the repository.
