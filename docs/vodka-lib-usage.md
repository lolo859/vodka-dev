# vodka-lib usage

## Introduction

vodka-lib is the internal C++ library that powers the Vodka transcoder and its ecosystem. It provides the full logic and toolset used to analyze, transform, and validate Vodka code before it's converted into Kernel code. While not directly exposed to end users, it's the backbone of the entire language pipeline. This documentation only covers currently implemented components (including those in beta) and does not describe future or theoretical features.
